        	<p> Design Research Portfolio from May 2019 to August 2020. I started as a summer intern at <a href="https://designcenter.illinois.edu" target="_blank" style="font-size: 30px; border-bottom: solid 4.5px;">Siebel Center for Design at Illinois</a> as a design research intern and later accepted a full-time position as a design strategist.

					<p>
					As an alumnus at <a href="https://grainger.illinois.edu" target="_blank" style="font-size: 30px; border-bottom: solid 4.5px;">Grainger College of Engineering</a> at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Iâ€™m deeply rooted in the engineering community through human-centered design processes. <br><br>

					Throughout my time at Siebel Center for Design, I have dedicated my work to understand and improve engineering student experience and college perceptions through the SCD taxonomy. My team role shifted from design researcher in a small two-person research team to design strategist where I got the chance to co-lead two undergraduate interns and go through the whole process from researching planning to the final presentation at a rapid pace in two months.
