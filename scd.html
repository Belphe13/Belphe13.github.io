					As an alumnus at <a href="https://grainger.illinois.edu" target="_blank" style="font-size: 30px; border-bottom: solid 4.5px;">Grainger College of Engineering</a> at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Iâ€™m deeply rooted in the engineering community through human-centered design processes. <br><br>

					Throughout my time at Siebel Center for Design, I have dedicated my work to understand and improve engineering student experience and college perceptions through the SCD taxonomy. My team role shifted from design researcher in a small two-person research team to design strategist where I got the chance to co-lead two undergraduate interns and go through the whole process from researching planning to the final presentation at a rapid pace in two months. <br><br>

					Here I will go in detail about the research project related to Grainger student experience and engagement amid the pandemic.

				<p>
				SCD has been tasked to use a human-centered approach to explore and understand the options for creating engagement opportunities at Grainger College of Engineering in a COVID-19 world.<br><br>

				After the kickoff meeting over Zoom, we drafted a research proposal that presented to stakeholders and quickly dived into the user research recruitment. We conducted one-hour-long interview sessions with students that have experience online learning to get the student perspectives. And we identified several opportunity areas and shared them back to participants and improved based on student feedbacks.
