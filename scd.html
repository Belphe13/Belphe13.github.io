        	<p>Design Research Portfolio from May 2019 to August 2020 during my time at <i><a href="https://designcenter.illinois.edu" target="_blank" style="font-size: 30px; border-bottom: solid 4.5px;">Siebel Center for Design at Illinois</a></i>. I started off as a summer research intern focusing on understanding perceptions from other higher education institutions and providing insights for branding the newly-named Grainger College of Engineering at University of Illinois. Later I continued to work as a full-time design strategist, and led several student research teams on student experience and online education using a human-centered approach.

					Throughout my time at Siebel Center for Design, I have dedicated my work to understand and improve engineering student experience and college perceptions through the SCD taxonomy. My team role shifted from design researcher to design strategist where I got the chance to co-lead undergraduate interns and go through the whole process from researching planning to the final presentation at a rapid pace in two months as response to moving education online.<br><br>

					Here I will briefly go over this research project related to Grainger student experience and engagement amid the pandemic.

				<br>

				<p>SCD has been tasked to use a human-centered approach to explore and understand the options for creating engagement opportunities at Grainger College of Engineering in a COVID-19 world.<br><br>

				We drafted a research proposal that presented to stakeholders and quickly dived into the user research recruitment. We conducted one-hour-long interview sessions with students that have experience online learning to get the student perspectives. And we identified several opportunity areas and shared them back to participants and improved based on student feedbacks.
