				<p>STUDENT EXPERIENCE</p><br>
			</div>

			<div class="description">
				<p>In response to the global pandemic and in anticipation of its lasting effects, it will be vitally important to re-imagine how Grainger College of Engineering might offer meaningful engagement opportunities for students to interact with their peers, instructors, and the larger UIUC community. This project uses human-centered design research to assess student and instructor needs and desires in building community both inside and outside of the classroom and to identify and implement adaptable and scalable programs/tools/experiences in Fall 2020 and beyond.
				</p><br>
			</div>

			<div class="subtitle">
				<p>PROBLEMS</p>
			</div>

			<div class="description">
				<ul>
					<li>What have other institutions implemented to create community and engagement during this period of alternative instruction? What has been successful and what has been a failure?</li>
					<li>What does the current engagement landscape look like for Grainger students? For Grainger faculty and TAs?</li>
					<li>How might elements of the current engagement landscape be translated to a virtual environment? What new tools, experiences, or supports need to be created?</li>
					<li>What tools or processes have worked, and what have not? Where are there opportunities for improvement?</li>
					<li>What are the minimum viable improvements that can be rapidly deployed for Fall 2020?</li>
					<li>How might these improvements be adapted or scaled to meet the needs of all Grainger students?</li>
					<li>How can Grainger communicate these improvements to students who have concerns about enrolling in the Fall?</li>
				</ul>
			</div>

			<br>

			<div class="subtitle">
				<p>RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
			</div>

			<div class="description">
				<ul>
					<li>Co-led the project team within a group of 5</li>
					<li>Met with stakeholders and proposed research plan</li>
					<li>Conducted 10+ student interviews and co-creation sessions</li>
					<li>Synthesized interview findings and present to Grainger Engineering leadership team</li>
					<li>Compiled a quick guide for quality remote instructions</li>
				</ul>

				<p>RESEARCH PLAN</p>
			</div>

			<br>

			<div class="description">
				<img src="img/projects/scd/gse-timeline.png" width="100%">

			<br>

				<p>The research team drafted a proposal that was presented to stakeholders and quickly dived into the user research recruitment. I conducted 12 30-minute-long interview and feedback sessions with students that have experience online learning to get the student perspectives. And I identified several opportunity areas and shared them back to participants for further feedback.

			<div class="subtitle">
				<p>RESEARCH FINDINGS</p>
			</div>

			<div class="description">
				<p>
					Our initial insights are broken down into 3 categories: academic, social and personal.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					Academic:
				</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Remote education can limit student opportunities and comfortability with engaging with instructors.</li>
						<li>Remote education can limit access to the hands-on experience students want.</li>
					</ol>
					<br>
				<p>
					Social:
				</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Virtual education can make it more difficult to find and form study groups.</li>
						<li>Students go to events to meet new people or to engage with the small group they came with, both difficult to recreate virtually.</li>
						<li>On campus, connections are often a result of daily interstitial interactions.</li>
					</ol>

					<br>
				<p>
					Personal:
					<ol>
						<li>Remote education can make structuring time more difficult for students.</li>
						<li>Many students' productivity is strongly influenced by space association.</li>
						<li>Students seem to miss the moments that remind them of the passage of time.</li>
					</ol>
				</p>
			</div>

			<br>

			<div class="subtitle">
				<p>DELIVERABLES</p>
			</div>

			<div class="description">
				<p>I presented one research readout amid the research process as well as the final presentation to the leadership team with my team members. I also initiated the collaboration with our graphic design team to create a guideline for remote instructions and disseminated our research findings for internal use.
